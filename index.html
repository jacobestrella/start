<h3>Smells Like Teen Spirit</h3>

<p>Load up on guns, bring your friends<br>
It's fun to lose and to pretend<br>
She's over-bored and self-assured<br>
Oh no, I know a dirty word</p>

<p>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello</p>

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah
Hey
Yay
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah
Hey
Yay
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Ooh well, whatever, nevermind
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
